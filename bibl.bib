	abstract = {The pygidial (anal) gland was found to be the source of trail pheromone in the antTapinoma simrothi. Bioassays conducted with fractionated pygidial gland secretion indicated that the fraction containing iridodials and iridomyrmecin is responsible for the trail pheromone activity. Thus workers ofT. simrothi may utilize the same glandular exudate for alarm and trail following. At high emission rates from a point source, the ants responded in alarm, e.g., rushed to the source with open mandibles and raised abdomen. When concentrations were low and drawn as a line, the ants followed the secretion calmly. Trails ofT. simrothi are long-lived, having a biological half-life of 10 to 19 days. Quantitative studies of the evaporation rates of the iridodials by gas chromatography resulted in a half-life of 11 days, agreeing with the biological data. The implications of the use of the same glandular secretion for alarm and food recruitments are discussed.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new set of reinforcement learning (RL) tasks in Minecraft (a flexible 3D world). We then use these tasks to systematically compare and contrast existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) architectures with our new memory-based DRL architectures. These tasks are designed to emphasize, in a controllable manner, issues that pose challenges for RL methods including partial observability (due to first-person visual observations), delayed rewards, high-dimensional visual observations, and the need to use active perception in a correct manner so as to perform well in the tasks. While these tasks are conceptually simple to describe, by virtue of having all of these challenges simultaneously they are difficult for current DRL architectures. Additionally, we evaluate the generalization performance of the architectures on environments not used during training. The experimental results show that our new architectures generalize to unseen environments better than existing DRL architectures.},
